## Deprecation Notice

This module was deprecated on March 9th, 2023.  Please contact support@kochava.com if you have any questions.

## KochavaTracker iOS SDK (GameKit Variant)

The KochavaTracker iOS SDK allows advertisers to integrate a single SDK to leverage the hundreds of ad network and publisher partners integrated with Kochava. This limits the number of 3rd party SDKs required to run a successful UA strategy and greatly reduces complexity during update cycles.

Kochava is a leading mobile attribution and analytics platform.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

* iOS 8.0
* ARC

## Installation

KochavaTrackeriOSGK is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "KochavaTrackeriOSGK"
```

## Author

## Default Branch

As of October 1, 2020, github.com uses the branch name ‘main’ when creating the initial default branch for all new repositories.  In order to minimize any customizations in our github usage and to support consistent naming conventions, we have made the decision to rename the ‘master’ branch to be called ‘main’ in all Kochava’s github repos.

For local copies of the repo, the following steps will update to the new default branch:

```
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```
